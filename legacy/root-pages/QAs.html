											<span class="question-text">Why did you choose computational psychology as your research focus?</span>
											<i class="fas fa-chevron-down toggle-icon"></i>
										</button>
										<div class="qa-answer">
											<p>My intellectual journey into computational psychology commenced during my undergraduate studies when I recognized the transformative potential of integrating rigorous psychological theories with sophisticated computational methodologies. While traditional psychological research often relies on small-scale studies and subjective interpretations, computational approaches enable researchers to analyze vast, complex datasets and uncover intricate behavioral patterns that would be impossible to detect through conventional manual analysis.</p>
											<p>What particularly captivates me is how computational methodologies can effectively bridge the conceptual gap between individual-level psychological processes and large-scale social phenomena. For instance, in my current research on marital interactions, I employ advanced natural language processing techniques to systematically analyze thousands of spousal conversations, revealing sophisticated communication patterns that reliably predict relationship satisfaction outcomes. This unprecedented scale and precision of analysis was virtually unimaginable just a decade ago.</p>
											<p>I firmly believe that computational psychology represents the future trajectory of psychological research, offering unprecedented opportunities to understand complex human behavior through sophisticated data-driven insights while maintaining the theoretical rigor and empirical standards that psychological science demands.</p>

										<button class="qa-question" aria-expanded="false">
											<span class="question-text">How did you transition from traditional psychology to computational methods?</span>
											<i class="fas fa-chevron-down toggle-icon"></i>
										</button>
										<div class="qa-answer">
											<p>My transition was gradual but deliberate. It started during my undergraduate thesis when I encountered limitations in traditional statistical methods for analyzing complex behavioral data. I began self-learning Python and discovered the power of machine learning for psychological research.</p>
											<p>The turning point came when I joined Dr. Xiaoyi Fang's lab at Beijing Normal University. Working on the NSFC-funded marital interaction project, I had the opportunity to apply computational methods to real psychological questions. I taught myself advanced NLP techniques, including BERT fine-tuning and topic modeling, specifically to address our research needs.</p>
											<p>This hands-on experience taught me that computational skills aren't just tools—they're new ways of thinking about psychological phenomena. Each method I learned opened up new research questions and possibilities that I hadn't considered before.</p>

										<button class="qa-question" aria-expanded="false">
											<span class="question-text">What drives your interest in multimodal data analysis?</span>
											<i class="fas fa-chevron-down toggle-icon"></i>
										</button>
										<div class="qa-answer">
											<p>Human behavior is inherently multimodal—we communicate through words, gestures, facial expressions, and physiological responses simultaneously. Traditional research often examines these modalities in isolation, missing the rich interactions between them.</p>
											<p>My experience with fMRI data analysis and text processing has shown me how different data types can provide complementary insights. For example, while text analysis reveals what people say, neuroimaging shows how their brains process information, and behavioral measures capture their actual responses. Integrating these perspectives provides a more complete understanding of psychological processes.</p>
											<p>I'm particularly excited about the potential of multimodal approaches for understanding complex phenomena like marital dynamics, where verbal communication, emotional expression, and physiological synchrony all play crucial roles. This holistic approach aligns with my belief that psychology should embrace the full complexity of human experience.</p>
