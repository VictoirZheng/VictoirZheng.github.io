								<h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
								
								<div class="interest-category">
									<h3><i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i> Intellectual Pursuits</h3>
									<div class="interest-content">
										<p>I'm deeply passionate about <strong>philosophy of mind</strong> and regularly engage with fundamental questions about consciousness, free will, and the nature of human subjective experience. This philosophical curiosity directly informs my research methodology, helping me think critically about the epistemological assumptions underlying psychological theories and the ontological status of computational models of human behavior.</p>
										<p>I also avidly consume <strong>popular science literature</strong> and regularly engage with works by leading scholars such as Daniel Kahneman, Steven Pinker, and Lisa Feldman Barrett. This intellectual habit keeps me connected to broader scientific conversations across disciplines and significantly enhances my ability to communicate complex psychological and computational concepts to diverse audiences.</p>
									</div>
								</div>

								<div class="interest-category">
									<h3><i class="fas fa-palette"></i> Creative Expression</h3>
									<div class="interest-content">
										<p><strong>Photography</strong> has been a longtime hobby that has unexpectedly enhanced my research skills. The process of composing shots, understanding lighting, and capturing meaningful moments has improved my attention to detail and visual thinking - skills that prove invaluable when designing experiments and presenting data.</p>
										<p>I also enjoy <strong>creative writing</strong>, particularly short stories that explore psychological themes. This creative outlet helps me think about human behavior from different angles and has improved my ability to craft compelling research narratives.</p>
									</div>

								<div class="interest-category">
									<h3><i class="fas fa-running"></i> Physical & Mental Wellness</h3>
									<div class="interest-content">
										<p><strong>Long-distance running</strong> is both a physical activity and a form of meditation for me. The discipline required for training mirrors the persistence needed in research, and the mental clarity I gain during runs often leads to breakthrough insights about ongoing projects.</p>
										<p>I practice <strong>mindfulness meditation</strong>, which has not only improved my personal well-being but also deepened my understanding of attention and consciousness - central themes in my research on human cognition.</p>

							<!-- Cultural Background & Personal Growth -->
							<section class="cultural-background-section">
								<h2>Cultural Background & Personal Journey</h2>
								
								<div class="growth-story">
									<h3>Growing Up in China's Educational Transformation</h3>
									<p>I grew up during a fascinating period in China's educational evolution, witnessing the shift from traditional rote learning to more innovative, critical thinking approaches. This experience gave me a unique perspective on <strong>educational psychology</strong> and the cultural factors that influence learning and development.</p>
									
									<p>Coming from a family of educators - my mother is a high school teacher and my father works in educational administration - I developed an early appreciation for the <strong>power of education to transform lives</strong>. However, I also observed the challenges within traditional educational systems, which sparked my interest in understanding how people learn and develop in different cultural contexts.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="growth-story">
									<h3>Bridging Eastern and Western Perspectives</h3>
									<p>My academic journey has been profoundly shaped by the opportunity to engage with both Eastern and Western psychological traditions. I've learned to appreciate the <strong>holistic thinking</strong> (整体思维, zhengti siwei) emphasized in Chinese philosophical traditions while embracing the <strong>empirical rigor</strong> and methodological precision of Western scientific approaches.</p>
									
									<p>This bicultural perspective has been invaluable in my research on marital relationships, where I can draw from both Confucian concepts of <strong>harmony</strong> (和谐, hexie) and <strong>relational interdependence</strong> alongside Western theories of attachment and communication. The Chinese concept of <strong>"guanxi"</strong> (关系, meaning relationship networks and social connections) provides a unique lens for understanding interpersonal dynamics that complements Western individualistic frameworks. I believe this cross-cultural theoretical integration will be a significant asset in contributing to the global psychological research community.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="growth-story">
									<h3>Overcoming Challenges & Building Resilience</h3>
									<p>Like many international students, I've faced challenges in adapting to different academic cultures and communication styles. Initially, I struggled with the more direct communication style expected in international academic settings, having grown up in a culture that values indirect communication and saving face.</p>
									
									<p>However, these challenges became opportunities for growth. I learned to <strong>embrace constructive criticism</strong>, <strong>advocate for my ideas confidently</strong>, and <strong>build bridges between different communication styles</strong>. This experience has made me more adaptable and empathetic when working with diverse teams.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="growth-story">
									<h3>Future Aspirations & Global Impact</h3>
									<p>My long-term goal is to contribute to psychological research that transcends cultural boundaries while respecting cultural differences. I envision developing interventions and theories that are both scientifically rigorous and culturally sensitive.</p>
									
									<p>I'm particularly excited about the potential for <strong>computational approaches to bridge cultural gaps</strong> in psychological research. By using NLP and machine learning to analyze communication patterns across cultures, we can develop more inclusive theories of human behavior and more effective interventions for diverse populations.</p>
								</div>

							<!-- Community Involvement -->
							<section class="community-section">
								<h2>Community Involvement & Leadership</h2>
								
								<div class="community-activity">
									<h3><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Mental Health Advocacy</h3>
									<p>I'm passionate about reducing mental health stigma, particularly in Chinese communities where mental health issues are often misunderstood. I've organized awareness campaigns and support groups, reaching over 200 students and community members.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Co-founded the "Mind Matters" student organization at BNU</li>
										<li>Organized monthly mental health awareness events</li>
